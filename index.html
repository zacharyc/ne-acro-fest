      <ol>

          MANDATORY pre-travel rapid COVID test. We are trusting our community
          and will not have the capacity to check for proof of rapid tests.
          However, anyone exhibiting symptoms may be requested to take a test
          and/or asked to leave the festival upon refusal. We reserve the right
          to use our judgment in such cases. We have a medical professional on
          staff to assist in such assessments.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is HIGHLY ENCOURAGED that you wear a mask while traveling and
          anytime you are with large crowds of people outside of the festival
          facility. Rapid home Covid tests are readily available and you should
          start making plans to have your test ready before the festival.
        </li>
        <li>We RECOMMEND being up to date on current vaccinations</li>
        <li>OPTIONAL masking in the facility</li>
        <li>Policy is subject to change based on CDC recommendations</li>
